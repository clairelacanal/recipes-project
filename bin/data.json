So I recommend starting with  of a large avocado and mashing it and then measuring it out and only keeping 1/3 cup for your chocolate truffles. Bring a small pot with water about 1 inch deep to a simmer. Add a bowl on top that is wider than your pot so that it doesnt touch the water. Place in chocolate and stir until completely melted and smooth. Add melted chocolate to the food processor and blend until no avocado streaks remain. Chill the chocolate mixture for about 20-25 minutes in the fridge so that it is slightly less sticky and a little more firm, but still soft and workable. You dont want to chill the dough too long because then the chocolate will firm up too much. Measure out 1 tbsp of chocolate mixture and roll between palms to form a smooth, round ball. Repeat with remaining chocolate. Place finished balls on a sheet of parchment paper. Spread 1 tbsp cocoa powder onto parchment paper. Roll balls in cocoa powder. Serve immediately or keep in the fridge.",

In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together sugars, oil, applesauce and vanilla. With mixing speed on low, beat in one egg at a time. Add the grated carrot and mix until just combined.\n\n3. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and chopped walnuts. With mixing speed on low, slowly add the dry ingredients. Mix until combined.\n\n4. In a medium size mixing bowl (using a hand mixer or a sturdy spatula) beat together cream cheese, powdered sugar, egg, salt and vanilla bean paste until smooth and creamy. Set aside.\n\n5. Pour the carrot cake batter into the prepared pan, then top with cream cheese mixture, making sure to spread evenly across the batter. Place in oven and bake for 30-35 minutes (or about 1 hour for a loaf). The cream cheese should be lightly browned on top, and yes, it will crack! Remove from oven and allow to cool in pan for 30 minutes (longer for a large loaf). Remove from pan and allow to cool for 15 more minutes before serving.",

Choosing the right size tray is important as the height of chocolate is decided depending on how much you pour.Add the heavy whipping cream into a small saucepan and bring it to ALMOST boil over medium heat. Keep an eye on the cream; when you see bubbles around the saucepan, remove from the heat.Add the chocolate and stir till the chocolate and cream are completely combined. Add liqueur of your choice (optional).Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Smooth the surface (which I forgot) and refrigerate until firm, about 4-5 hours (or overnight).Remove the chocolate from the baking dish and cut it into cubes using a warm knife. Make sure to warm the knife after each cutting to prevent splintering. You can use hot running water but wipe it off completely before each cut.Sprinkle the cocoa powder and serve it chilled. You can keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days but enjoy soon.",

Take the pan off the heat and stir in the gelatine until dissolved. Let the mixture cool a little, then divide between 10 serving dishes. Place in the fridge for at least 5 hrs, or preferably overnight.\nCover a baking sheet with some baking parchment. Melt the chocolate either in the microwave (1-2 mins should do it) or in a bowl set over a small pan of boiling water. Pour the melted chocolate into a small freezer bag. Make a piping bag by snipping off a tiny piece of one corner. Now pipe out 10 spider-web shapes onto the baking parchment: pipe a circle with a smaller circle inside, then pipe lines coming out from the centre like the spokes of a wheel. Place the chocolate spider webs in the fridge to harden. Just before serving, carefully peel away each spider web from the parchment and place on top of a jelly.",

Cook on low, stirring continuously, until the chocolate is melted. Stir until the chocolate is smooth, and allow it to sit and cool slightly while you prepare the prunes.\nInsert the almonds into the centers of the prunes, one nut per prune. I find its easier to use the tapered end of the nut to poke into the center of the prune. If you have difficulty, can use a paring knife to create a small hole for inserting the nut.\nUse a fork or dipping tools to dip one of the prunes into the chocolate, submerging it completely. Remove it from the chocolate and drag the bottom along the lip of the bowl to remove the excess chocolate. Place it on the prepared baking sheet and, if desired, sprinkle the top with crushed nuts while the chocolate is still wet.\nRepeat the dipping with the remaining prunes and chocolate. Once all of the prunes are on the baking sheet, let the chocolate set like this (dont put them in the fridge because Chocolate Plums will look mat). Store Chocolate Plums in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.",

Let the eggs boil for 1 minute (no more). Then remove the pan from the heat, and cover snugly with a lid. Let the eggs continue to cook in the panfor 9-11* minutes, or until the yolks reach your desired level of doneness.Carefully drain out the hot water (or you can also transfer the eggs to a colander,and then return them to the pot). Then fill the pot with ice water, and let the eggs sit for a few minutes until they are completely chilled.Peel and serve the eggs immediately. Or transfer them to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 1 week.*Granted, different pots/stoves may cause the eggs to cook more/less quickly, so test what cooking time will work best in your kitchen. I've found a good solid 10 minutes of cooking time works best for me.",

  "instructions": "Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Line the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan with parchment paper or waxed paper and grease the sides of the pan. (Be sure to grease the sides really well!) Wrap the outside of the pan with 2 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil and set it in a large roasting pan, or any pan that's larger than the springform. Bring a kettle or pot of water to boil.In a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, beat the eggs at high speed until the volume doubles. This usually takes about 5 minutes.Meanwhile, melt the chocolate and butter together. You can either do this in a double boiler on the stove (by placing the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl, set over a pan of almost-simmering water, and stirring until melted and smooth). Or you can do this in the microwave (by heating the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate and butter are melted and smooth). Then fold about a third of the beaten eggs into the chocolate mixture using a large rubber spatula until only a few streaks of egg are visible. Fold in half of the remaining egg foam, and then the last half of the foam, until the mixture is totally homogenous.Scrape the batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with a rubber spatula. Place the roasting pan on the oven rack and VERY carefully pour in enough boiling water to come about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake until the cake has risen slightly, the edges are just beginning to set, a thin-glazed crust (like a brownie) has formed on the surface, and an instant-read thermometer inserted halfway into the center reads 140° F, 22-25 minutes. Remove the springform pan from the water bath and set on a wire rack; cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until cool. (The cake can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.)About 30 minutes prior to serving, carefully remove the sides of the springform pan, invert the cake onto a sheet of waxed paper, peel off the parchment paper, and reinvert the cake onto a serving platter. If desired, lightly dust the cake with powdered sugar and top with berries. To slice, use a sharp, thin-bladed knife, dipping the knife into a pitcher of hot water and wiping the blade before each cut.",

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.",

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses.

   "instructions": "<p>1) To make the meatballs, combine the bread, egg, milk, and salt, stirring till everything is well moistened. Allow to sit for about 10 minutes to soften.2) Add the ground meat, onion, cheese, and herbs. Mix gently till thoroughly combined.3) Shape tiny meatballs, (about 1\" diameter or less). Using a level teaspoon scoop (which volume-wise is actually 2 level measuring teaspoons) makes about the right size. Place the meatballs on a parchment-lined or lightly greased cookie sheet, and refrigerate them while you prepare the soup.  4) Get out a large pot, at least 6-quart capacity. Pour the olive oil into the bottom of the pot, and add the onions and carrots. Saut, stirring frequently, until the onions are translucent and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook for another couple of minutes.  5) Add the broth and herbs, bring to a simmer, and cook gently for 10 minutes.6) Add the frozen chopped spinach, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, total; the soup will take awhile to come back to a simmer, due to the frozen spinach. Help it along by breaking it up with a fork as it cooks.7) Gently drop the meatballs into the soup. Simmer the soup for 30 minutes or so, then stir in the pasta, cooking till it's al dente. For orzo, this will take about 8 minutes or so.8) Add salt and pepper to taste; using reduced-salt canned chicken broth, we added 1 teaspoon salt; and 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper.9) Serve the soup garnished with freshly grated Parmesan or Asiago cheese.Yield: 29 cups, about sixteen 12-ounce servings.</p>",

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses.

Start out with 1/2 cup and work your way up to 1 cup if needed--mixture should look a little different than the other mixture.  If too dry, add more condensed milk.  Take the brownie pan out of the freezer and scoop this mixture in and spread.  Freeze again.For the top layer, add about ~3/4 cup-1.5 cups of the condensed milk to the milk chocolate and stir.  Use 3/4 cup if you want it like real fudge or 1.5 cups if you want your top layer to look like mine.  Pour into the brownie pan and freeze until top layer is firm, then slice (I didn't do this because I'm impatient.  I think I waited a good twenty minutes before slicing and devouring)",

Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Miranda Lambert Liar Unoaked Chardonnay Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 28 dollars per bottle.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.",
